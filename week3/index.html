                  <p class="main-text">
                    Medical law is a branch of law that is concerned about the duties of the medical professionals and the rights of the patient. Medical law is guided by ethics which are;
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">1.	Beneficence </span>  – this is doing what is in the best of the patient.
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">2.	No maleficence</span> - the medical service should ensure that the patient doesn’t worsen off.
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">3.	Autonomy</span> – this is patient self-rule.
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">4.	Justice</span> - all patients should be treated fairly and receive equal care.
                    In Kenya medical rights are provided in <a href="https://article43.blogspot.com/2011/02/article-43-of-constitution-of-kenya.html"> article 43(1) (a)</a> of the constitution of Kenya and in the Health act of 2017.  including reproductive health care. Every patient is assured of privacy and has to give consent to all medical care he or she receives.
                    
                  </p>
                  <p class="header">Why Medical Law <span> +</span></p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                    It is important that people are aware of their rights and that medical practitioners are aware of the consequences that may become if they breach duty of care of the patient. The patients also need to know when and where to sue and they should be able to judge if the medical practitioner is liable of the damages that may occur during and after treatment or if the case was out of their hands.   
                  </p>

                  <p class="main-text">
                    The world is facing a pandemic which has led to the demise of so many people. The scientists have tried to come up with a vaccine. Some are for it while some are against it for their own certain reasons. Either way, the question is if a government declare that vaccination is compulsory for everyone to ensure safety for everyone. This question applies to many similar situations that involves the consent of the patient. Health act of 2017 Sec. 9(1) No specified health service may be provided to Consent.
                    a patient without the patient's informed consent unless—
                    <br>
                    (A) the patient is unable to give informed consent
                    and such consent is given by a person mandated by the patient in writing to grant consent on his or her behalf; or authorized to give such consent in terms of any law or court order;
                    <br>
                    (B) the patient is unable to give informed consent and no person is mandated or authorized to give such consent, but the consent is given by the next of kin;
                    <br>
                    (C) the provision of a health service without informed consent is authorized by an applicable law or court order; the patient is being treated in an emergency situation; failure to treat the user, or a group of people which includes the user, will result in a serious risk to public health; or any delay in the provision of the health service to the patient might result in his or her death or irreversible damage to his or her health and the patient has not expressly, or by implication or by conduct refused that service. 
                    <br>
                    A health care provider must take all reasonable steps to obtain the user's informed consent.
                    The constitution protects everyone from being forced to take any medication, vaccine or go through any medical procedure without consent being given by the patient. However, the Kenyan constitution does not accept euthanasia, that is mercy killing. The same applies to abortion.

                  <p class="header">Medical Negligence  <span> +</span></p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                    Medical negligence is a malpractice that involves improper or unskillful treatment of a patient.
                    In the    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Strouds-Judicial-Dictionary-Vol-6-James/dp/0421366303">Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary 5th edition,</a>  medical negligence is defined as follows:
                    “In relation to professional negligence I regard the phrase “gross negligence” only as indicating so marked a departure from the normal standard of conduct of a professional man as to infer a lack of that ordinary care which a man of ordinary skill would display. A Doctor is not guilty of negligence if he has acted accordance with a practice accepted by a responsible body of medical men skilled in that particular form of treatment.” 
                    In the case of <a href="http://kenyalaw.org/caselaw/cases/view/179489/"> R Vs Bateman (1925) 19 Cr App R 8 </a>the court stated as follows,
                    “If a person holds himself as possessing special skill and knowledge and he is consulted, as possessing such skill and knowledge by a patient, he owes the duty to the patient to use due caution in undertaking treatment. If he accepts the responsibility and undertakes treatment and the patient submits to his direction and treatment accordingly he owes the duty to the patient and to use diligence, care, knowledge, skill and caution in administering the treatment.”
