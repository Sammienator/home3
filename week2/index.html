                  <p class="header">Defining Jurisdiction of courts <span> +</span></p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                    What is jurisdiction? It is the powers a certain court has to make a judgement over a certain case. In Kenya, the judiciary has a hierarchy for courts. These are superior courts which are supreme court, Court of appeal, High court, Industrial and Environment and land court and the subordinate courts are the magistrates court kadhis court and martial courts. It is important for a counsel to be able to identify the court that best suits a case.  
                  </p>
                  <p class="header">Types of Jurisdiction <span> +</span></p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">1.	Pecuniary jurisdiction</span> - the claim will usually be having a certain value. Taken to the resident magistrate’s court. 
                    For example: for a contract law case where one party does not pay the amount he or she is supposed to for a good or service delivered the following procedure can be followed before taking the matter to court. 
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">2.	Personal laws</span>- the only court that entertains personal laws in Kenya is the kadhis court. 
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">3.	Subject matter jurisdiction</span> – the courts have been gazetted to listen to certain matter, such as children’s court, court martial.
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">4.	Territorial jurisdiction</span>- implies to the geographical boundaries.Cases are taken to the nearest court that has the jurisdiction to handle the case.
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">5.	Appellate jurisdiction</span> - courts that handle appeals e.g. Court of appeal.
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans">6.	Original jurisdiction</span> - courts handling new cases.
                    There are courts that handle both appellate and original jurisdiction e.g. The high court.
                    <br>

                    Judiciary is one of the arms of the government in charge of interpretation of the constitution. It is found in chapter 10 of the constitution. The judiciary also is the arm of government which is believed to stand for the “common mwanainchi” when all other arms of the government use their power to exploit the citizens. The judiciary protects the constitution. This was seen recently in the BBI Court of appeal ruling. 
                    The supreme court is established under <a href="https://klrc.go.ke/index.php/constitution-of-kenya/135-chapter-ten-judiciary/part-2-superior-courts/332-163-supreme-court">article 163 of the 2010 constitution.</a> In Kenya, the supreme handles both original and appellate cases. For example, presidential election cases are taken to the supreme as it is the only court with the jurisdiction to handle that case. 
  
                  </p>
          
                  <p class="header">Other information <span> +</span></p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                    Kenya allows deportation of non-citizens to be tried in courts in their own countries. That however does not mean we do not have jurisdiction over the offences committed. This is because countries have bilateral agreement that allows deportation of aliens to be tried for offences that have been done in their own country.
                  </p>
                  <p class="header">Demand letter.  <span> +</span></p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                    This is a letter sent to a party which has breached a contract. It gives you an ultimatum.
                    a.	To accept liability.
                    b.	Ultimatum to pay the amount that hasn’t being paid or issue a payment plan.
                    c.	Consequences of not adhering to the payment plan which is to be sued.
                    It is important for the lawyer handling the case as illustrated in type one of jurisdiction to ensure that all possible solutions are exhausted before taking the mater to a court. 
                    
                    
                  </p>

                  <p class="header">In Conclusion <span> +</span></p>
                  <p class="main-text">
                    Knowledge of jurisdiction of courts is a very important tool especial for legal professionals. Cases should be taken to courts after considering the factors that come with the case and the having the knowledge on types of jurisdiction. 
                    <br> For example, cases that involves persons in the army is taken to court martial and cases on presidential election dispute are taken to the supreme court.
                    <br>
                    <span class="spans"> Note: </span> Judges accused of an offence are not taken to courts as they have their own process to follow. They go through the Judicial Service Commission. This is necessary as it ensure that the dignity of the judges is persevered and that no judge is relieved from his or her duty because he or she made a ruling that was not in favor of the government as it makes it hard for a judge to be removed without sufficient evidence. Such a process ensures that judges make fair rulings as no one is going to be on their necks.
